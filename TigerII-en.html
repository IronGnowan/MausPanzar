<h2>A.k.a <mark>Tiger II</mark></h2>
<hr>

<p title="Maus"><b>Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B</b></p>
<pre><em> The Tiger II was a German heavy tank of the Second World War. The final official German designation was 
Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B, often shortened to Tiger B. The ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 182.
(Sd.Kfz. 267 and 268 for command vehicles). It was also known informally as the Königstiger (German for Bengal tiger, lit. 'King Tiger').
Contemporaneous Allied soldiers often called it the King Tiger or Royal Tiger. The Tiger II was the successor to the Tiger I, 
combining the latter's thick armour with the armour sloping used on the Panther medium tank. It was the costliest German tank 
to produce at the time. The tank weighed almost 70 tonnes, and was protected by 100 to 185 mm (3.9 to 7.3 in) of armour to the front.
It was armed with the long barrelled (71 calibres) 8.8 cm KwK 43 anti-tank cannon. The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger
turretless Jagdpanzer anti-tank vehicle. The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army and the Waffen-SS. It was 
first used in combat by 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion during the Allied invasion of Normandy on 11 July 1944; on the Eastern Front,
the first unit to be outfitted with the Tiger II was the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion. Due to heavy Allied bombing, only 492 were produced.</em></pre>

<h2>History of the Tiger 2</h2>
<hr>
<pre><i>
    Development started in 1937 with a design contract awarded to Henschel. Another design contract followed in 1939, given to Porsche. Both 
prototypes used the same turret design from Krupp. The main differences were in the hull, transmission, suspension and automotive features.The 
Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and
used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimetre-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on transverse torsion bars, 
in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, the wheels were only overlapping without being 
interleaved—the full Schachtellaufwerk rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved 
design, later inherited by the Tiger I and Panther.The Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension
was the same as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion 
bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive 
(fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric
hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drivetrains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; 
gasoline engine electric generator electric motor drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been used on the rejected Tiger (P) design, which
had been rebuilt as Elefant, and in some US designs and was put into production in the French World War I era Saint-Chamond tank and post-
World War I Char 2C. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to 
use hydraulic drives; Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.

Henschel won the design contract, and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm. Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial
design is often misleadingly called the "Porsche" turret due to the misbelief that it was designed by Porsche for their Tiger II prototype; in fact
it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes. This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture 
curved bulge on the turret's left side to accommodate the commander's cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel hulls and used in action.
In December 1943 the more common "production" turret, sometimes erroneously called the "Henschel" turret, was simplified with a significantly 
thicker flat face (which eliminated the shot trap caused by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which avoided 
the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.The turrets were designed to mount the 
8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 gun. Combined with the Turmzielfernrohr 9d (German "turret telescopic sight") monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early 
Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high,
2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) wide target was 100 percent at 1,000 m (1,100 yd), 95/97 percent at 1,500 m (1,600 yd) and 85/87 percent at 2,000 m (2,200 yd),
depending on ammunition type.[citation needed] Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000 m, in the 60s at 1,500 m 
and the 40s at 2,000 m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was 202 and 132 mm (8.0 and 5.2 in) at 100 m (110 yd) and 2,000 m 
(2,200 yd) respectively for the Panzergranate 39/43 projectile (PzGr  armour-piercing shell), and 238 and 153 mm (9.4 and 6.0 in) for the 
PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges.[citation needed] The Sprenggranate 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets,
or the Hohlgranate or Hohlgeschoss 39 (HlGr  HEAT or High-explosive anti-tank warhead) round, which had 90 mm (3.5 in) penetration at any range, 
could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets. 


Powered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a 
secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees
at 6º/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19º/second  the same as with the Tiger I  with the high speed setting and engine at 
2000 rpm, and over 36º/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3,000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse was controlled by the gunner
through foot pedals, whilst a high torque low speed (useful when on slopes) or low torque high speed final gearing could be selected via a control
lever near his left arm. This system allowed for very precise control of powered traverse, a light touch on the pedal resulting in a minimum 
traverse speed of 0.1 deg/sec (360 degrees in 60 min), unlike in most other tanks of the time (e.g. US M4 Sherman or Soviet T-34 medium tanks) 
this allowed for fine laying of the gun without the gunner needing to use his traverse handwheel. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out 
of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret 
at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank; a 20° turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn 
the turret a full 360° the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions.Like all German tanks, the Tiger II had a petrol 
engine; in this case the same 700 PS (690 hp, 515 kW) V-12 Maybach HL 230 P30 which powered the much lighter Panther and Tiger I tanks. 



The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans.
The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR OG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was 
the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles
per side. Overlapped 800 mm (31 in) diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks. Late production Tiger Is 
received the same wheels, which were one of the few interchangeable parts between the two tanks. Like the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two 
sets of tracks: a normal "battle track" and a narrower "transport" version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width
of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon 
as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76 kg/cm2 (10.8 psi).

<h2>A.k.a <mark>Tiger II</mark></h2>
<hr>

<p title="Maus"><b>Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B</b></p>
<pre><em> The Tiger II was a German heavy tank of the Second World War. The final official German designation was 
Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B, often shortened to Tiger B. The ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 182.
(Sd.Kfz. 267 and 268 for command vehicles). It was also known informally as the Königstiger (German for Bengal tiger, lit. 'King Tiger').
Contemporaneous Allied soldiers often called it the King Tiger or Royal Tiger. The Tiger II was the successor to the Tiger I, 
combining the latter's thick armour with the armour sloping used on the Panther medium tank. It was the costliest German tank 
to produce at the time. The tank weighed almost 70 tonnes, and was protected by 100 to 185 mm (3.9 to 7.3 in) of armour to the front.
It was armed with the long barrelled (71 calibres) 8.8 cm KwK 43 anti-tank cannon. The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger
turretless Jagdpanzer anti-tank vehicle. The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army and the Waffen-SS. It was 
first used in combat by 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion during the Allied invasion of Normandy on 11 July 1944;[14] on the Eastern Front,
 the first unit to be outfitted with the Tiger II was the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion. Due to heavy Allied bombing, only 492 were produced.</em></pre>

<h2>History of the Tiger 2</h2>
<hr>
<pre><i>
    Development started in 1937 with a design contract awarded to Henschel. Another design contract followed in 1939, given to Porsche. Both 
prototypes used the same turret design from Krupp. The main differences were in the hull, transmission, suspension and automotive features.The 
Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and
used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimetre-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on transverse torsion bars, 
in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, the wheels were only overlapping without being 
interleaved—the full Schachtellaufwerk rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved 
design, later inherited by the Tiger I and Panther.The Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension
was the same as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion 
bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive 
(fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric
hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drivetrains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; 
gasoline engine electric generator electric motor drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been used on the rejected Tiger (P) design, which
had been rebuilt as Elefant, and in some US designs and was put into production in the French World War I era Saint-Chamond tank and post-
World War I Char 2C. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to 
use hydraulic drives; Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.

<h2>A.k.a Mighty Maus</h2>
<hr>

<p title="Maus"><b>Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus</b></p>
<pre>   <em>Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus (English: 'mouse') is a German World War II super-heavy tank 
completed in July of 1944. It is the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever
built. Five were ordered, but only two hulls and one turret were completed, the turret being
attached before the testing grounds were captured by advancing Soviet military forces.
These two prototypes underwent trials in late 1944. The complete vehicle was 10.2 m (33 ft) long,
3.71 m (12.2 ft) wide and 3.63 m (11.9 ft) high. Weighing about 188 metric tons, the Maus's 
main armament was the Krupp-designed 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun, based on the 12.8 cm Pak 44 towed 
anti-tank gun also used in the casemate-type Jagdtiger tank destroyer, with a coaxial 
75 mm KwK 44 L/36.5 gun. The 128 mm gun was powerful enough to destroy all Allied armored 
fighting vehicles in service at the time, with some at ranges exceeding 3,500 m (3,800 yd).

    The principal problem in the design of the Maus was developing an engine and drivetrain powerful
enough to adequately propel the tank, yet small enough to fit inside it as it was meant to use the 
same sort of "hybrid drive", using an internal-combustion engine to operate an electric generator to
power its tracks with electric motor units, much as its Porsche-designed predecessors, the VK 30.01 (P),
VK 45.01 (P), and Elefant had. The drivetrain was electrical, designed to provide a maximum speed of 
20 km/h (12 mph) and a minimum speed of 1.5 km/h (0.9 mph). However, during actual field testing, 
the maximum speed achieved on hard surfaces was 13 km/h (8.1 mph) with full motor field, and by weakening 
the motor field to a minimum, a top speed of 22 km/h (14 mph) was achieved. The vehicle's weight made 
it unable to use most bridges; instead it was intended to ford to a depth of 2 m (6.6 ft) or submerge 
up to a depth of 8 m (26 ft) and use a snorkel to cross rivers.</em></pre>

<h2>History of Panzerkampfwagen VIII(Maus)</h2>
<hr>
<pre><i>
    The development of the Maus originates from a contract given to Porsche for the design of a 100-ton tank in 
March 1942. Porsche's design, known as the VK 100.01 / Porsche Type 205,[9] was shown to Adolf Hitler in 
June 1942, who subsequently approved it. Work on the design began in earnest; the first prototype, to be ready
in 1943 was initially to receive the name Mammut ('mammoth'). This was reportedly changed to Mäuschen 
('little mouse') in December 1942 and finally to Maus ('mouse') in February 1943, which became the most 
common name for this tank.

    The Maus was designed from the start to use the "electric transmission" design which Ferdinand Porsche had used 
in the VK 4501 (P), his unsuccessful attempt to win the production contract for the Tiger. The initial powerplant
was the Daimler-Benz MB 509 gasoline engine, an adaptation of Germany's largest displacement (at 44.5 L (2,720 cu in))
inverted V12 aircraft engine, the Daimler-Benz DB 603 petrol engine, and later changed to the Daimler-Benz MB 517 
diesel engine. This drove an electrical generator, and their combined length occupied the central/rear two-thirds 
of the Maus' hull, cutting off the forward driver's compartment in the hull from direct access to the turret from 
within the tank. Each 1.1-meter-wide track, which used the same basic "contact shoe" and "connector link" design format
as the Henschel-built Tiger II, was driven by its own electric motor mounted within the upper rear area of each hull 
side. Each set of tracks had a suspension design containing a total of 24 road wheels per side, in six bogie sets, 
staggered to be spread over the entire width of the track.

    Due to the return "run" of the uniquely 110 cm-wide tracks used being completely enclosed within the fixed outer side 
armor panels that defined its overall hull width, with the inner vertical lengthwise walls of the hull used to mount the
suspension components, a narrow lengthwise "tub" remained between the hull's inner armored walls, under and to the rear
of the turret to house the engine and generator of the tank's powertrain.

    The armor was substantial: the hull front was 220 mm (8.7 in) thick, the sides and rear of the hull were up to 190 mm (7.5 in).
The turret armor was even thicker, the turret front was up to 240 mm (9.4 in)[9] and the sides and rear 200 mm (7.9 in). 
The gun mantlet was 250 mm (9.8 in), and combined with the turret armor behind, the protection level at that section was even
higher. The initial plan for the Maus was for the prototype to have been completed by mid-1943, with monthly production scheduled
to run at ten vehicles per month after delivery of the prototype. The work on the Maus would be divided between Krupp, responsible
for the chassis, armament and turret and Alkett, who would be responsible for final assembly.

    The Maus tank was originally designed to weigh approximately 100 tons and be armed with a 128 mm main gun and a 75 mm co-axial
secondary gun. Additional armament options were studied including various versions of 128 mm, 150 mm, and 170 mm guns. In January 
1943 Hitler himself insisted that the armament be a 128 mm main gun with a coaxial 75 mm gun. The 128 mm PaK 44 anti-tank field 
artillery piece of 1943 that Krupp adapted for arming the Maus as the Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 44 retained, in parallel to the Porsche
project, its original anti-tank Panzerabwehrkanone family designation of PaK 44 when mounted in the casemate-style Jagdtiger tank 
destroyer. By May 1943, a wooden mockup of the final Maus configuration was ready and presented to Hitler, who approved it for 
mass production, ordering a first series of 150. At this point, the estimated weight of the Maus was 188 tons.

    In his book Panzer Leader, Heinz Guderian wrote:
On 1 May a wooden model of the "Maus", a tank project of Porsche and Krupp, was shown to Hitler. It was intended to mount a 150 mm gun. 
The total weight of the tank was supposed to reach 175 ton. It should be considered that after the design changes on Hitler's instructions 
the tank will weigh 200 ton. The model didn't have a single machine gun for close combat, and for this reason they had to reject it. 
It had the same design flaw that made the Elefant unsuitable for close combat. In the end, the tank will inevitably have to wage a 
close combat since it operates in cooperation with the infantry. An intense debate started, and except for me, all of the present 
found the "Maus" magnificent. It was promising to be exactly that, a "giant".</i>
